## Required Workflows

The [workflows](./workflows) defined in this repository are meant to be used by other repositories
within this organization. They should be included in a [repository
ruleset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)
at the organization level. This is not done automatically. When adding a new workflow, be sure to
also update the corresponding ruleset
[here](https://github.com/organizations/enterprise-contract/settings/rules).

An existing ruleset may prevent direct pushes to the default branch, e.g. `main`, for a variety of
reasons. Although pushing a commit directly to `main` is not recommended, certain occasions require
it. For example, it is not possible to create a pull request targeting a brand-new empty repository.
In such cases, add a temporary exception target for the corresponding ruleset. Remember to revert
this change. Alternatively, avoid creating empty repositories altogether by always choosing to
include a license.
